# FarmersProlog
Solved the Farmer,Cabbage, Wolf and Goat problem using both breadth first, and depth-first search.

With breadth-first algorithm, **queue**(First In First Out) is used. In addition to this, it checks whether a vertex has been discovered before enqueueing
the vertex rather than delaying this check until the vertex is dequeued from the queue

With depth-first algorithm, **stack**(First In Last Out) is used.
